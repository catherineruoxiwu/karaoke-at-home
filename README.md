# KTVGen

## Description:

**ktvgen** is a fullstack karaoke generator with a web app and CLI tool. It allows users to input song links, separate vocals and instrumentals using AI, and generate KTV-style videos. The project uses React and Tailwind on the frontend, FastAPI with SQLModel on the backend, and relies on `yt-dlp`, `demucs`, `ffmpeg`, and `torch` for audio processing.

## CLI
```
pip install -e .
ktvgenerate --link ... --video
```

## Frontend (In Progress)
```
cd frontend
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```
